#### px 

- is a fixed unit, representing a specific number of pixels on the screen. This means it doesn't change with the context.

- suitable for defining exact dimensions, like borders, margins, padding and fixed-width layouts

#### em 

- is a relative unit, relative to the font-size of its closest parent elements. 

- For eg: if the parent element has a font-size of 20px, then 1em equals 20px

- Often used for responsive designs, allows for more flexible scaling relative to the parent element's fort size
